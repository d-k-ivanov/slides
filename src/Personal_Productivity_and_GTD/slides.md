# PRODUCTIVITY PROBLEMS IN THE MODERN WORLD

- **Why corals?**
- The amount of inbound information nowadays is **huge** and it's **impossible to process everything** properly.

--

- Daily planning does not exist at all.

--

- Fear to be buried under all inbound tasks.

--

- Laziness...

--

- **"I don't have time enough"** to start arranging activities.
